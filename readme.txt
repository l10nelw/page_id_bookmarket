Bookmarklet that returns a string of text containing identifying information for the current webpage (for select webpages). The text can be copied and used as a helpful source-pointing filename, if you wish to save the item to disk. This is useful for media files saved from the web: video, audio, photos, webcomics, etc. Or just about anything that may not provide its own source url.

Generally the author is the first part of the string, to help you group items by author.

Supported webpages:
reddit post - [username] [post id]
reddit comment - [username] [post id] [comment id]
youtube - [channel name] [video id] [video title]
deviantart - [url with '/' replaced with ' ']
instagram* - [username] [post id]
facebook - [name] [url with 'www.facebook.com', '/', and '?' replaced with ' ']
